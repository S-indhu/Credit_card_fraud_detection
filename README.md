## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using historical transaction data, the model identifies suspicious activity, helping to prevent potential fraud.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Libraries: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset includes:
- Features: 30 anonymized features (V1, V2, ..., V30) and the time of transaction.
- Target variable: `Class` (1 for fraud, 0 for not fraud).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have a Google account to access Google Colab. There are no other installations required since all necessary libraries are included in the Colab environment.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A1Ed5rAGZ6cwWKqjLVjbu2361UuwE6sE)
2. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Results
- Model Performance: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Confusion Matrix: Provides a visual representation of model performance.

## Conclusion
The model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with a certain level of accuracy. Future work could include exploring more advanced models, hyperparameter tuning, and deploying the model for real-time detection.
